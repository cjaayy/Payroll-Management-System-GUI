# QUICK FIX: Database Migration Required

## Problem
You're getting an error: `Column 'comprehensive_employee_id' not found.`

This happens because the new comprehensive employee ID feature requires an additional database column that doesn't exist in your current database.

## Solution

### Option 1: Run Migration Script (Recommended)
1. **Using Command Line**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the project folder
   cd "c:\Users\mjhay\Desktop\Payroll Management System GUI"
   
   # Run the migration (replace credentials if different)
   mysql -hlocalhost -uroot -pJisoo@010322 payroll_system < migrate_add_comprehensive_id.sql
   ```

2. **Using Batch File**:
   - Double-click `run_migration.bat`
   - Follow the prompts

3. **Using PowerShell**:
   - Right-click `run_migration.ps1` and "Run with PowerShell"
   - Follow the prompts

### Option 2: Manual Database Update
If you prefer to run the migration manually:

1. Open MySQL Workbench or command line
2. Connect to your `payroll_system` database
3. Run this command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN comprehensive_employee_id VARCHAR(50) AFTER employee_id;
   ```

### Option 3: Use Legacy Mode (Temporary)
The application has been updated to work with or without the new column. Just recompile and run:

```bash
# Recompile the application
javac -d classes -cp "lib/*;src" src\models\*.java src\managers\*.java src\gui\*.java src\database\*.java

# Run the application
java -cp "lib/*;classes" gui.PayrollManagementSystemGUI
```

## After Migration

Once you've added the column, the application will:
- ✅ Support comprehensive IDs like `IT-202501-001`
- ✅ Continue supporting legacy IDs like `EMP001`
- ✅ Allow flexible search with both formats
- ✅ Automatically generate meaningful IDs for new employees

## Verification

After running the migration, you can verify it worked by:
1. Starting the application
2. Going to Employee Management
3. Adding a new employee
4. The employee should get a comprehensive ID like `IT-202501-001`

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that MySQL is running
2. Verify your database credentials in `DatabaseConfig.java`
3. Ensure the `payroll_system` database exists
4. Check the console output for detailed error messages

The application is now backward compatible and will work whether you have the new column or not!
