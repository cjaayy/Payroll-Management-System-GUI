### Updated Access Control Implementation

### HR vs Admin Comparison

| Feature | Admin | HR Officer | Payroll Officer | Employee |
|---------|-------|------------|-----------------|-----------|
| User Management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Employee Management | ✅ | ✅ | 👁️ Read Only | 👁️ Own Only |
| Payroll Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 👁️ Own Only |
| Reports | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| System Settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Audit Trail | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Enhanced Role Checking**: Added specific HR role validation methods
2. **Permission-Based Access**: Implemented granular permission system
3. **GUI Access Updates**: Modified all panels to respect HR permissions
4. **User Management**: HR users can now manage other user accounts
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all access levels work correctly

### Usage Notes

- HR users have nearly full administrative privileges except for system-level settings
- All HR actions are logged in the audit trail for compliance
- HR users can create and manage other user accounts including employees
- Password security policies apply to all HR-managed accounts
- HR users can access the User Management panel from the main menu

### Security Considerations

- HR users cannot escalate their own privileges to Admin
- All sensitive operations require proper authentication
- Failed access attempts are logged and monitored
- Account lockout policies apply to HR accounts as well

This implementation provides a robust HR access level that balances operational needs with security requirements.
