# Comprehensive Employee ID Management System

## Overview

The Payroll Management System now includes a sophisticated employee ID management feature that creates meaningful, unique identifiers for every employee. The system generates comprehensive employee IDs based on department codes, hire dates, and sequential numbering.

## Employee ID Format

### Primary Format: Department-Date-Sequence
- **Format**: `DEPT-YYYYMM-XXX` (e.g., `IT-202501-001`, `HR-202501-002`)
- **Components**:
  - **Department Code**: 2-3 character abbreviation (IT, HR, FIN, MKT, etc.)
  - **Hire Date**: YYYYMM format (year and month)
  - **Sequence Number**: 3-digit sequential number within that department/month

### Fallback Format: Legacy Support
- **Format**: `EMP001`, `EMP002`, etc. (for backward compatibility)
